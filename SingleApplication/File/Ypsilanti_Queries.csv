Michigan Public Act 451, 1994, as amended (“Part 201”), and provides an independent, professional  evaluation and opinion regarding existing environmental conditions associated with the subject property.  The BEA establishes a liability exemption for the cleanup of existing contamination at the subject  property.   This BEA was conducted on January 20, 2017. On behalf of James & James Holdings, LLC, this BEA is  being submitted to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ).  The property is described in further detail in Section 2.0. A legal description for the property is included  in Appendix A. Refer to Figure 1 for a topographic location map and Figure 2 for a site map.  1.1 Owner/Operator Information  This BEA was prepared by AKT Peerless on behalf of the following:  Prospective Property Owner:  James & James Holdings, LLC  539 S. Huron Street  Ypsilanti, Michigan 48197                                                               1  “Facility” means any area, place, or property where a hazardous substance in excess of the concentrations that satisfy the  cleanup criteria for unrestricted residential use has been released, deposited, disposed of, or otherwise comes to be located.  Facility does not include any area, place, or property where any of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) Response activities  have been completed under this part that satisfy the cleanup criteria for unrestricted residential use. (ii) Corrective action has  been completed under Part 213 that satisfies the cleanup criteria for unrestricted residential use. (iii) Site‐specific criteria that  have been approved by the department for application at the area, place, or property are met or satisfied and both of the  following conditions are met: (A) The site‐specific criteria do not depend on any land use or resource use restriction to ensure  protection of the public health, safety, or welfare or the environment. (B) Hazardous substances at the area, place, or property  that are not addressed by site‐specific criteria satisfy the cleanup criteria for unrestricted residential use.  BEA | 539 S. HURON STREET, YPSILANTI, MICHIGAN  PAGE 1    1.2 Intended Use of the Property  James & James Holdings, LLC intends to purchase the subject property on February 8, 2017, and intends  to redevelop the subject property for continued commercial use as a medical marijuana dispensary.  1.3 Summary of All Appropriate Inquiry Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)  On November 3, 2016, McDowell & Associates (McDowell) prepared a Phase I ESA for the subject  property in general conformance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard  Practice E 1527‐13 on behalf of James & James Holdings, LLC. The area subject to McDowell’s  assessment included the subject property as described in Section 2.0 and the southern adjoining  property located at 569 S. Huron Street, which consisted of wooded land totaling approximately 1.18  acres.  McDowell identified the following recognized environmental conditions (RECs) in connection with the  subject property:  REC 1 ‐  Based on historic sources reviewed, the northern portion of the property was previously used as  a gasoline station. The 1950 and 1964 fire insurance maps depict three underground storage  tanks (USTs) along S. Huron Street. No records were found regarding the removal of these USTs.  Building department records indicate a new gasoline station was constructed in 1972 with five  USTs north of the building, near Kramer Street. Five USTs were reportedly removed in 1986. No  prior sampling and analyses‐related documentation has been provided to McDowell &  Associates, nor was it available in local building, assessing, and fire department records or the  re observed in the parking lots  MDEQ. Five monitoring well covers labeled “Amoco Test Well” we during the site reconnaissance.  REC 2 ‐  The database report identified the subject property address of 539 S. Huron Street on the  Brownfield database. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was submitted to the MDEQ  to review available files for that site; however, MDEQ personnel indicated that no files were  found for that address.  REC 3 ‐  The log of soil boring sheets for two soil borings advanced on the property show between 3’9”  and 7’‐0” of fill soil on the property. The origin of the fill soil is unknown.  REC 4 ‐  The eastern and southern adjoining property was historically the City of Ypsilanti landfill.  According to city records, methane was reported in soil borings made on that site in 2013 above  the lower explosive limit (LEL) for methane gas. In addition, PNAs and metals were reported in  groundwater at that site above MDEQ Generic Residential Cleanup Criteria. A Notice of  Migration of Contamination was submitted for contaminants near the subject property  boundary.  REC 5 ‐  The database report identified 30 Kramer Property, which adjoins the subject property to the  east, as a Brownfiled site. According to the database report, this site was developed in 1850 as a  dwelling. Auto repair was conducted at this address from 2004 to 2010. Accomplished  Brownfield activities at that site included a Phase I ESA. No other information was included in  the database report. McDowell & Associates submitted an FOIA request to the MDEQ to review  the file for that site. MDEQ personnel indicated that no files were found for that address. This  data gap is considered a significant data gap at this time.  BEA | 539 S. HURON STREET, YPSILANTI, MICHIGAN  PAGE 2    In addition, McDowell identified the following potential environmental concerns in connection with the  subject property:   The existing building is planned for demolition. Prior to demolition, an Asbestos Survey should  be conducted. If regulated asbestos‐containing materials are identified, the materials should be  removed by a licensed asbestos contractor prior to demolition.   The northern adjoining property is an existing gasoline station with four currently‐in‐use USTs.  While this site is listed as a “closed” leaking underground storage tank (LUST) site, an adjoining  gasoline station located up gradient from the subject property is considered a potential  environmental concern to the subject property.  AKT Peerless has not evaluated the quality of the McDowell’s Phase I ESA report or formed an opinion as  to whether environmental concerns were adequately investigated.  A copy of the Phase I ESA is included in Appendix B.  1.4 AAI Exceptions or Deletions   McDowell did not report deviations from the AAI Rule or ASTM Standard Practice E 1527‐13 when  performing the Phase I ESA (i.e., no components of that practice were deleted, and no additions to it  were made).  1.5 Data Gaps  Except as noted above, McDowell did not report any instances of significant data gaps during the course  of the Phase I ESA.  1.6",

Intended Use of the Property  James & James Holdings, LLC intends to purchase the subject property on February 8, 2017, and intends  to redevelop the subject property for continued commercial use as a medical marijuana dispensary.  1.3 Summary of All Appropriate Inquiry Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA)  On November 3, 2016, McDowell & Associates (McDowell) prepared a Phase I ESA for the subject  property in general conformance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard  Practice E 1527‐13 on behalf of James & James Holdings, LLC. The area subject to McDowell’s  assessment included the subject property as described in Section 2.0 and the southern adjoining  property located at 569 S. Huron Street, which consisted of wooded land totaling approximately 1.18  acres.  McDowell identified the following recognized environmental conditions (RECs) in connection with the  subject property:  REC 1 ‐  Based on historic sources reviewed, the northern portion of the property was previously used as  a gasoline station. The 1950 and 1964 fire insurance maps depict three underground storage  tanks (USTs) along S. Huron Street. No records were found regarding the removal of these USTs.  Building department records indicate a new gasoline station was constructed in 1972 with five  USTs north of the building, near Kramer Street. Five USTs were reportedly removed in 1986. No  prior sampling and analyses‐related documentation has been provided to McDowell &  Associates, nor was it available in local building, assessing, and fire department records or the  re observed in the parking lots  MDEQ. Five monitoring well covers labeled “Amoco Test Well” we during the site reconnaissance.  REC 2 ‐  The database report identified the subject property address of 539 S. Huron Street on the  Brownfield database. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was submitted to the MDEQ  to review available files for that site; however, MDEQ personnel indicated that no files were  found for that address.  REC 3 ‐  The log of soil boring sheets for two soil borings advanced on the property show between 3’9”  and 7’‐0” of fill soil on the property. The origin of the fill soil is unknown.  REC 4 ‐  The eastern and southern adjoining property was historically the City of Ypsilanti landfill.  According to city records, methane was reported in soil borings made on that site in 2013 above  the lower explosive limit (LEL) for methane gas. In addition, PNAs and metals were reported in  groundwater at that site above MDEQ Generic Residential Cleanup Criteria. A Notice of  Migration of Contamination was submitted for contaminants near the subject property  boundary.  REC 5 ‐  The database report identified 30 Kramer Property, which adjoins the subject property to the  east, as a Brownfiled site. According to the database report, this site was developed in 1850 as a  dwelling. Auto repair was conducted at this address from 2004 to 2010. Accomplished  Brownfield activities at that site included a Phase I ESA. No other information was included in  the database report. McDowell & Associates submitted an FOIA request to the MDEQ to review  the file for that site. MDEQ personnel indicated that no files were found for that address. This  data gap is considered a significant data gap at this time.  BEA | 539 S. HURON STREET, YPSILANTI, MICHIGAN  PAGE 2    In addition, McDowell identified the following potential environmental concerns in connection with the  subject property:   The existing building is planned for demolition. Prior to demolition, an Asbestos Survey should  be conducted. If regulated asbestos‐containing materials are identified, the materials should be  removed by a licensed asbestos contractor prior to demolition.   The northern adjoining property is an existing gasoline station with four currently‐in‐use USTs.  While this site is listed as a “closed” leaking underground storage tank (LUST) site, an adjoining  gasoline station located up gradient from the subject property is considered a potential  environmental concern to the subject property.  AKT Peerless has not evaluated the quality of the McDowell’s Phase I ESA report or formed an opinion as  to whether environmental concerns were adequately investigated.  A copy of the Phase I ESA is included in Appendix B.  1.4 AAI Exceptions or Deletions   McDowell did not report deviations from the AAI Rule or ASTM Standard Practice E 1527‐13 when  performing the Phase I ESA (i.e., no components of that practice were deleted, and no additions to it  were made).  1.5 Data Gaps  Except as noted above, McDowell did not report any instances of significant data gaps during the course  of the Phase I ESA.  1.6",

On November 3, 2016, McDowell & Associates (McDowell) prepared a Phase I ESA for the subject  property in general conformance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard  Practice E 1527‐13 on behalf of James & James Holdings, LLC. The area subject to McDowell’s  assessment included the subject property as described in Section 2.0 and the southern adjoining  property located at 569 S. Huron Street, which consisted of wooded land totaling approximately 1.18  acres.  McDowell identified the following recognized environmental conditions (RECs) in connection with the  subject property:  REC 1 ‐  Based on historic sources reviewed, the northern portion of the property was previously used as  a gasoline station. The 1950 and 1964 fire insurance maps depict three underground storage  tanks (USTs) along S. Huron Street. No records were found regarding the removal of these USTs.  Building department records indicate a new gasoline station was constructed in 1972 with five  USTs north of the building, near Kramer Street. Five USTs were reportedly removed in 1986. No  prior sampling and analyses‐related documentation has been provided to McDowell &  Associates, nor was it available in local building, assessing, and fire department records or the  re observed in the parking lots  MDEQ. Five monitoring well covers labeled “Amoco Test Well” we during the site reconnaissance.  REC 2 ‐  The database report identified the subject property address of 539 S. Huron Street on the  Brownfield database. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was submitted to the MDEQ  to review available files for that site; however, MDEQ personnel indicated that no files were  found for that address.  REC 3 ‐  The log of soil boring sheets for two soil borings advanced on the property show between 3’9”  and 7’‐0” of fill soil on the property. The origin of the fill soil is unknown.  REC 4 ‐  The eastern and southern adjoining property was historically the City of Ypsilanti landfill.  According to city records, methane was reported in soil borings made on that site in 2013 above  the lower explosive limit (LEL) for methane gas. In addition, PNAs and metals were reported in  groundwater at that site above MDEQ Generic Residential Cleanup Criteria. A Notice of  Migration of Contamination was submitted for contaminants near the subject property  boundary.  REC 5 ‐  The database report identified 30 Kramer Property, which adjoins the subject property to the  east, as a Brownfiled site. According to the database report, this site was developed in 1850 as a  dwelling. Auto repair was conducted at this address from 2004 to 2010. Accomplished  Brownfield activities at that site included a Phase I ESA. No other information was included in  the database report. McDowell & Associates submitted an FOIA request to the MDEQ to review  the file for that site. MDEQ personnel indicated that no files were found for that address. This  data gap is considered a significant data gap at this time.  BEA | 539 S. HURON STREET, YPSILANTI, MICHIGAN  PAGE 2    In addition, McDowell identified the following potential environmental concerns in connection with the  subject property:   The existing building is planned for demolition. Prior to demolition, an Asbestos Survey should  be conducted. If regulated asbestos‐containing materials are identified, the materials should be  removed by a licensed asbestos contractor prior to demolition.   The northern adjoining property is an existing gasoline station with four currently‐in‐use USTs.  While this site is listed as a “closed” leaking underground storage tank (LUST) site, an adjoining  gasoline station located up gradient from the subject property is considered a potential  environmental concern to the subject property.  AKT Peerless has not evaluated the quality of the McDowell’s Phase I ESA report or formed an opinion as  to whether environmental concerns were adequately investigated.  A copy of the Phase I ESA is included in Appendix B.  1.4 AAI Exceptions or Deletions
